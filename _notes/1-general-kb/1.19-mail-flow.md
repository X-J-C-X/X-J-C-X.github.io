# 1.19-mail-flow

## Overview

[MS learn article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/manage-mail-flow-using-third-party-cloud#scenario-1---mx-record-points-to-third-party-spam-filtering)

## Details

### MX record points to third-party spam filtering

Important

Microsoft strongly recommends that you enable Enhanced Filtering for Connectors or bypass filtering completely using a mail flow rule (check out point 5). Failure to follow this step inevitably results in misclassification of inbound main into your organization, and a subpar experience for Microsoft 365 email and protection features.

Microsoft also recommends that you add third-party services that modify messages in transit as [Trusted ARC sealers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/email-authentication-arc-configure), if the service supports ARC sealing. Add the service as a trusted ARC sealer helps affected messages pass email authentication checks, and helps prevent legitimate messages from being delivered to the Junk Email folder, quarantined, or rejected. Third-party services that modify messages and don't support ARC sealing will invalidate the DKIM signatures of those messages. In these cases, you should review the [Spoof detections report](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/reports-email-security#spoof-detections-report) and [create allow entries for spoofed senders](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/tenant-allow-block-list-email-spoof-configure#create-allow-entries-for-spoofed-senders) to override email authentication failures for legitimate messages.

I plan to use Exchange Online to host all my organization's mailboxes. My organization uses a third-party cloud service for spam, malware, and phish filtering. All email from the internet must first be filtered by this third-party cloud service before being routed to Microsoft 365 or Office 365.

For this scenario, your organization's mail flow setup looks like the following diagram:

![Mail flow diagram showing inbound email from the internet to a third-party filtering service to Microsoft 365 or Office 365 and from outbound mail from Microsoft 365 or Office 365 to the internet.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/exchange/exchangeonline/media/a8ee0cd5-6a4c-4e57-9030-0f233def25f3v2.png)


#### Best practices for using a third-party cloud filtering service with Microsoft 365 or Office 365

1. Add your custom domains in Microsoft 365 or Office 365. To prove that you own the domains, follow the instructions in [Add a domain to Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/setup/add-domain).

2. [Create user mailboxes in Exchange Online](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/create-user-mailboxes) or [move all users' mailboxes to Microsoft 365 or Office 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/exchange/mailbox-migration/mailbox-migration).

3. Update the DNS records for the domains that you added in step 1. (Not sure how to do this? Follow the instructions on [this page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/get-help-with-domains/create-dns-records-at-any-dns-hosting-provider).) The following DNS records control mail flow:    - **MX record**: Your domain's MX record must point to your third-party service provider. Follow their guidelines for how to configure your MX record.

- **SPF record**: All mail sent from your domain to the internet originates in Microsoft 365 or Office 365, so your SPF record requires the standard value for Microsoft 365 or Office 365:

`v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all`

Hornet: You would only need to include the third-party service in your SPF record if your organization sends **outbound** internet email through the service (where the third-party service would be a source for email from your domain).

![[Pasted image 20260129130931.png]]
In this example, the host name for the Microsoft 365 or Office 365 host should be **hubstream-mx.mail.protection.outlook.com**. This value can vary from domain to domain, so check your value at `**Configuration** > **Domain** > <select domain>` to confirm your actual value.







# Manage mail flow using a third-party cloud service with Exchange Online and on-premises mailboxes in Exchange Online

This topic covers the most complex mail flow scenario using Microsoft 365 or Office 365.

Note

Examples in this guide use the fictitious organization, Contoso, which owns the domain contoso.com. The IP address of the Contoso mail server is 131.107.21.231, and its third-party provider uses 10.10.10.1 for their IP address. These are just examples. You can adapt these examples to fit your organization's domain name and public-facing IP address where necessary.

- I'm migrating my mailboxes to Exchange Online, and I want to keep some mailboxes on my organization's on-premises email server. I want to use a third-party cloud service to filter spam from the internet. My messages to the internet must route through Microsoft 365 or Office 365 to prevent my on-premises servers' IP addresses from being added to external block lists.

In this scenario, your organization's mail flow setup looks like the following diagram.

![Mail flow diagram showing mail from the internet going to a third-party service then to Microsoft 365 or Office 365 and then to on-premises servers. Mail from on-premises servers goes to Microsoft 365 or Office 365 then to the internet (bypassing the third-party service).](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/exchange/exchangeonline/media/fc2c46f3-a1e4-45b7-845b-ff6197113673.png)

1. Add your custom domains in Microsoft 365 or Office 365. To prove that you own the domains, follow the instructions in [Add a domain to Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/setup/add-domain).
    
2. [Create user mailboxes in Exchange Online](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/create-user-mailboxes) or [move all users' mailboxes to Microsoft 365 or Office 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/exchange/mailbox-migration/mailbox-migration).
    
3. Update the DNS records for the domains that you added in step 1. (Not sure how to do this? Follow the instructions on [this page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/get-help-with-domains/create-dns-records-at-any-dns-hosting-provider).) The following DNS records control mail flow:
    
    - **MX record**: Point your MX record to your third-party service. Follow their guidelines for configuring your MX record.
        
    - **SPF record**: Because your domain's MX record must point to a third-party service (in other words, you require complex routing), include the third-party service in your SPF record. Follow the third-party provider's guidelines for adding them to your SPF record. Also add Microsoft 365 or Office 365 and the IP addresses of your on-premises servers as valid senders. For example, if contoso.com is your domain name, the third-party cloud service IP address is 10.10.10.1, and your on-premises server IP address is 131.107.21.231, the SPF record for contoso.com should be:
        
    
    ```
    v=spf1 ip4:10.10.10.1 ip4:131.107.21.231 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all
    ```
    
    Alternatively, depending on the third-party's requirements, you might need to include the domain from the third-party, as shown in the following example:
    
    ```
    v=spf1 ip4:131.107.21.231 include:spf.protection.outlook.com include:third_party_cloud_service.com -all
    ```
    

There are additional considerations in hybrid deployments between on-premises Exchange and Microsoft 365 or Office 365. For more information, see [Exchange Server hybrid deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/exchange/exchange-hybrid).
